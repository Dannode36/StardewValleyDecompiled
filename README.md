Stardew Valley 1.6 decompiled for a better understanding of how the game functions under the hood, and to ease the modding process

*Note: The StardewValley.csproj does have external references which you must provide yourself. The most important, MonoGame.Framework.dll, can be found in your Stardew Valley download folder (with the .exe). Simply copy this into the same folder with the .csproj and Visual Studio should detect it.*
